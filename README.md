# A Machine Learning Project for Credit Predictions

## Introduction
This project uses a dataset of 50,000 rows containing client dummy data to predict whether an individual will receive credit based on certain features. It implements machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, for prediction.

## Relevant Features from the Dataset
- **Month**: Refers to the month when the credit request was made.
- **Age**: The age of the client requesting the credit.
- **Annual Income**: The yearly income of the client.
- **Number of Bank Accounts**: The total number of bank accounts owned by the client.
- **Number of Credit Cards**: The total number of active credit cards the client possesses.
- **Interest Rate**: The interest rate applied to the requested credit.
- **Number of Loans**: The number of loans the client currently has before making the credit request.
- **Delays from Due Date**: The amount of time (in days) it took the client to pay a debt after its due date.
- **Number of Delayed Payments**: The total number of payments made after their due dates.
- **Credit Mix**: A numerical score reflecting the diversity of the client’s credit portfolio.
- **Credit History Age**: The duration (in years) of the client’s active credit history.
- **Monthly Balance**: The client’s average monthly balance, which is closely tied to their Annual Income.

## Installation
You can run this machine learning models in two ways, via cloud or locally in your environment.

## Cloud Deployment
If you want to use the interactive web app you can go directly to the web application [Credit Application](https://maujs-ml.streamlit.app/).
If you want to instead run this project locally, follow the steps below:

## Local Installation
To run the Project locally, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mau-JS/OracleML.git}
   cd OracleML
   ```
2. Installing required dependencies:
